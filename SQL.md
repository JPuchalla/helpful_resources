# SQL 

#### About

*S*tructured *Q*uery *L*anguage is how we interact with most databases. we can create, modify, or delete tables. We can find existing data within tables, insert new data, or change whatâ€™s there. We can add modifiers to our queries to scope them down to only entries matching certain criteria, or calculate aggregates on the fly.

#### Types 

PostgreSQL

* The best choice for both development and production

MySQL

* Popular and widely available, but avoid it if you can

MS SQL Server/Oracle

* Trusting your production stack to closed-source code is a non-starter

SQLite

* Great for experiments and local development, never use in production

#### SQLite

Stores its data in a plain-text file

* easy to move, rename, delete, or transfer the database
